<h1>Greetings, I'm Sid, an IT Specialist🌐</a></h1>

<h2>🧍🏼‍♂️ Who Am I?</h2>
    
  I'm a self-motivated tech nerd with a strong background in customer service and a love for anything tech related. I enjoy learning about tech not just for career reasons but becasue I genuinely enjoy it, Cyber Security particularly interests me and is what im planning on diving into next. I created a virtualized home lab to refine technical skills and always eager to learn more and interact with new people!
